	Bansuriyaa have been in this business of creating beautiful garments since long back into the hearts of kokata.It is today, a fashion house renowned for its original designs in fabrics, bridal ensembles and ready-to-wear outfits.
All of which is reflected in the breath-taking collection of readymade garments, which include sarees and outfits like lehengas, shararas, ghagra-cholis, salwar kameezes and more. In addition to bridal wear, Bansuriyaa also offers casual, formal, semi-formal and fusion apparel.
With tremendous hard work, honesty and an eye to pick the best of products in handloom sarees, they developed "BANSURIYAA" into a leading brand in Kolkata. Today we have two branches in the city, one at Taratala Road and another shortly opening in New Alipore. Today we deal not only in the best of sarees, but also carefully hand picked lehanga chunni, suits and fabrics
